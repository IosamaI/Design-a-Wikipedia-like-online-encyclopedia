Wiki: A Wikipedia-like Online Encyclopedia

Overview

The Wiki project is a web-based application designed to function as a simplified version of an online encyclopedia, similar to Wikipedia. This application allows users to create, edit, and search for pages in Markdown format, providing an intuitive platform for organizing and sharing knowledge.

This project was completed as part of CS50W (CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript) and adheres to the course’s requirements for distinctiveness and complexity, showcasing proficiency in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and Markdown processing.

Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements for the following reasons:

Distinctiveness:

Unlike many other projects in the course, Wiki focuses on content management using Markdown syntax, which is distinct from other applications like e-commerce or social media platforms. The Markdown-based editing and rendering system introduces a unique aspect to this project.

The ability to search for pages, handle non-existent entries, and edit existing content distinguishes it further as a fully functional knowledge-sharing platform.

Complexity:

The project involves dynamic content rendering by converting Markdown into HTML using the Python-Markdown library.

The implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations allows users to interact with the application seamlessly.

The search functionality ensures partial and case-insensitive matches, enhancing user experience.

Advanced Django techniques, such as URL routing and form handling, are utilized to manage user interactions.

Error handling is included for cases such as accessing non-existent pages or attempting to create duplicate entries.
